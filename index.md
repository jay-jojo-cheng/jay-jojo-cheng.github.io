# Hi there!
I am a 4th year PhD student developing methodology in statistical learning, causal inference, and precision medicine.
I enjoy this problem space because it naturally connects to many topics I like (optimization, high dimensional statistics, robustness) and is amenable to a variety of creative approaches.
Most importantly, progress in this field translates to improved health outcomes for patients.

My PhD advisor is [Guanhua Chen](https://stat.wisc.edu/staff/chen-guanhua/) in the [Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.
Prior to my PhD, I tried to be a doctor, worked in healthcare, did some cool projects with [Shruthi Mahalingaiah](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/shruthi-mahalingaiah/), and worked in a nonprofit.
Even before that, I received the AB in Mathematics from Princeton University, where I did some undergraduate research with [Charles Fefferman](https://www.math.princeton.edu/people/charles-fefferman).
